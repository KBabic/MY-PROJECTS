The tango music is intriguing, beautiful, demanding,\xe2\x80\xa6 and will take you further into your soul than you ever imagined!Welcome to a new community! Tango dancing is the opportunity to share wonderful danced moments with beautiful people\xe2\x80\xa6 It is also a great place to meet new people who, after so many shared classes, tandas and milongas, become close friends!That\xe2\x80\x99s our little secret, our uniqueness, our specialty. No other dance will bring you that feeling\xe2\x80\xa6. Connection is when the powerful yet delicate alchemy that exists between two dancers takes the dancing to another level. Whatever your level or your role in the dance, you\xe2\x80\x99re transported into new heights. Like falling in love with your best friend while eating chocolate cookies, that type of thing. It is the tango hook that makes us crave more\xe2\x80\xa6.Feeling a bit on the floppy side lately? Tango will take care of that. Dancing all night at a milonga is the equivalent of a 5-hours mountain hike\xe2\x80\xa6 with turns and beautiful music included. You\xe2\x80\x99ll soon learn how to use your core muscles for balance and your legs for power and fluidity on the dance floor\xe2\x80\xa6There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why us tango lovers spend so much time in classes! Tango is incredibly elegant and we\xe2\x80\x99re all aiming for a beautiful posture, fluidity and ease, while performing crazy back ochos and giros. Translate that into the real world, and you can spot a tango dancer from far away. Muscle memory doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work only in classes, and in our daily lives we\xe2\x80\x99re straighted, more relaxed, and, dare I say, happier?You can forget the awkward evenings in a noisy night club, unsure about what to do with yourself (yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been there too). We have beautiful milongas all year round where you can come and dance, meet friends, sip some wine in a relaxed and happy setting. Think Glamour meets Soul, with a twist of Old Age.I could have called this \xe2\x80\x9cthe beauty\xe2\x80\x9d. Sometimes in milongas we just want to sit and watch. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more beautiful than watching two people dancing together and looking absolutely connected. Add to that the fact that tango dancing has evolved to make dancers look amazingly good, and you get a sense of why people-watching becomes addictive\xe2\x80\xa6.In a world that never stops, tango offers the opportunity to take a moment to let go and be fully present, connected to someone. For the time of a tanda, we focus completely on the person we\xe2\x80\x99re dancing with, the music, and our dancing. We leave the world behind, one song at a time. No need for meditation classes when you\xe2\x80\x99re a dancer, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your tango\xe2\x80\xa6Watch out! Take a few tango classes, start going to milongas, feel the connection, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably get addicted\xe2\x80\xa6 but what a beautiful, healthy addiction dancing is!It started out as a small community of dancers in Buenos Aires at the turn of the 20th century, evolved, almost vanished in the 70s, then gradually came back\xe2\x80\xa6 today tango is danced all over the world. Advantage one: wherever you go, you can now plan a tango night in your travels. Advantage two: the tango trips! The ones you take with tango friends to a new place with the main aim of dancing. Told you we lead a glamorous life\xe2\x80\xa6.We\'re not around right now. But you can send us an email and we\'ll get back to you, asap.Start typing and press Enter to search
